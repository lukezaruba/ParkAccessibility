# ParkAccessibility
### An Assessment of Park Accessibility and Equity using GIS and Statistical Analyses

This project served as my undergraduate geography capstone project, and sought to model and visualize potential discrepancies in accessibility to parks in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

The project strictly utilized geospatial and statistical methods to find underlying differences in accessibility across census blocks with specific demographic characteristics. These included:
* Proximity analyses (Euclidean and Network based)
* Cluster/Outlier analyses (Anselin's Local Moran's I)
* Bivariate statistical analyses (Simple Linear Regression and ANOVA)

The research concluded that there is statistically significant evidence in favor of the claim that minority and low-income communities face greater difficulty in accessing parks. Furthermore, statistically significant evidence shows that the distribution of parks in the City of Minneapolis is inequitable and serves White and high-income communities more adequately.
